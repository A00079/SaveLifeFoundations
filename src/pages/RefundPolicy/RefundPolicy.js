SAVE LIFE FOUNDATION expects that all donors will exercise due care and diligence while making donations. SAVE LIFE FOUNDATION also recognizes that a donation may be made erroneously or donors may change their mind. SAVE LIFE FOUNDATION will examine request for refund of donation and endeavour to make the refund. SAVE LIFE FOUNDATION may also seek proper explanation and reason from the user. Also, it will require further verification of the user and need documents of proof as well as for donation.</p>
